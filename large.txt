Spiteful Zombie
A Screenplay by Writer Unknown
INT. QUALITY CAFE, LOS ANGELES - AFTERNOON

Intuitive shopkeeper MR MIKE BOND is arguing with funny homemaker DR STANLEY GREY. MIKE tries to hug STANLEY but she shakes him off.

MIKE
Please Stanley, don't leave me.
STANLEY
I'm sorry Mike, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces his fears head on, instead of running away.
MIKE
I am such a person!
STANLEY frowns.

STANLEY
I'm sorry, Mike. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
STANLEY leaves.

MIKE sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, sweet scout DI ROY FISH barges in looking flustered.

MIKE
Goodness, Roy! Is everything okay?
ROY
I'm afraid not.
MIKE
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
ROY
It's ... a zombie ... I saw an evil zombie kill a bunch of elderly gents!
MIKE
Defenseless elderly gents?
ROY
Yes, defenseless elderly gents!
MIKE
Bloomin' heck, Roy! We've got to do something.
ROY
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
MIKE
You can start by telling me where this happened.
ROY
I was...
ROY fans himself and begins to wheeze.

MIKE
Focus Roy, focus! Where did it happen?
ROY
National History Museum, London! That's right - National History Museum, London!
MIKE springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

MIKE rushes along the street, followed by ROY. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


INT. NATIONAL HISTORY MUSEUM, LONDON - SHORTLY AFTER

LAUREN BARKER a spiteful zombie terrorises two elderly gents.

MIKE, closely followed by ROY, rushes towards LAUREN, but suddenly stops in his tracks.

ROY
What is is? What's the matter?
MIKE
That's not just any old zombie, that's Lauren Barker!
ROY
Who's Lauren Barker?
MIKE
Who's Lauren Barker? Who's Lauren Barker? Only the most spiteful zombie in the universe!
ROY
Blinkin' knickers, Mike! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most spiteful zombie in the universe!
MIKE
You can say that again.
ROY
Blinkin' knickers, Mike! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most spiteful zombie in the universe!
MIKE
I'm going to need nets, lots of nets.
Lauren turns and sees Mike and Roy. She grins an evil grin.

LAUREN
Mike Bond, we meet again.
ROY
You've met?
MIKE
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young MIKE is sitting in a park listening to some indie music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over him.

He looks up and sees LAUREN. He takes off his headphones.

LAUREN
Would you like some toffees?
MIKE's eyes light up, but then he studies LAUREN more closely, and looks uneasy.

MIKE
I don't know, you look kind of spiteful.
LAUREN
Me? No. I'm not spiteful. I'm the least spiteful zombie in the world.
MIKE
Wait, you're a zombie?
MIKE runs away, screaming.


INT. NATIONAL HISTORY MUSEUM, LONDON - PRESENT DAY

LAUREN
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
ROY
(To MIKE) You ran away?
MIKE
(To ROY) I was a young child. What was I supposed to do?
MIKE turns to LAUREN.

MIKE
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
MIKE runs away.

He turns back and shouts.

MIKE
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with nets.
LAUREN
I'm not scared of you.
MIKE
You should be.

INT. SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

MIKE and ROY walk around searching for something.

MIKE
I feel sure I left my nets somewhere around here.
ROY
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly nets.
MIKE
You know nothing Roy Fish.
ROY
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, LAUREN appears, holding a pair of nets.

LAUREN
Looking for something?
ROY
Crikey, Mike, she's got your nets.
MIKE
Tell me something I don't already know!
ROY
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
MIKE
I know that already!
ROY
I still wear nappies.
LAUREN
(appalled) Dude!
While LAUREN is looking at ROY with disgust, MIKE lunges forward and grabs his deadly nets. He wields them, triumphantly.

MIKE
Prepare to die, you spiteful cauliflower!
LAUREN
No please! All I did was kill a bunch of elderly gents!
STANLEY enters, unseen by any of the others.

MIKE
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those elderly gents were defenceless! Well now they have a defender - and that's me! Mike Bond defender of innocent elderly gents.
LAUREN
Don't hurt me! Please!
MIKE
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these nets on you right away!
LAUREN
Because Mike, I am your mother.
MIKE looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects himself.

MIKE
No you're not!
LAUREN
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
LAUREN tries to grab the nets but MIKE dodges out of the way.

MIKE
Who's the mummy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, LAUREN slumps to the ground.

ROY
Did she just faint?
MIKE
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly nets.
MIKE crouches over LAUREN's body.

ROY
Be careful, Mike. It could be a trick.
MIKE
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Lauren Barker is dead!
MIKE
What?
MIKE
Yes, it appears that I scared her to death.
ROY claps his hands.

ROY
So your nets did save the day, after all.
STANLEY steps forward.

STANLEY
Is it true? Did you kill the spiteful zombie?
MIKE
Stanley how long have you been...?
STANLEY puts her arm around MIKE.

STANLEY
Long enough.
MIKE
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Lauren Barker.
STANLEY
Then the elderly gents are safe?
MIKE
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable elderly gents enter, looking relived.

STANLEY
You are their hero.
The elderly gents bow to MIKE.

MIKE
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Lauren Barker will never kill elderly gents ever again, is enough for me.
STANLEY
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the elderly gents passes MIKE a mystical bell

STANLEY
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
MIKE
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

MIKE
Well, if you insist.
MIKE takes the bell.

MIKE
Thank you.
The elderly gents bow their heads once more, and leave.

MIKE turns to STANLEY.

MIKE
Does this mean you want me back?
STANLEY
Oh, Mike, of course I want you back!
MIKE smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

MIKE
Well you can't have me.
STANLEY
WHAT?
MIKE
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a zombie to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
STANLEY
But...
MIKE
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Roy.
ROY grins.

STANLEY
But...
ROY
You heard the gentleman. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
STANLEY
Mike?
MIKE
I'm sorry Stanley, but I think you should skidaddle.
STANLEY leaves.

ROY turns to MIKE.

ROY
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
MIKE
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly ROY stops.

ROY
When I said I still wear nappies, you know I was just trying to distract the zombie don't you?
THE END
